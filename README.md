# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

In order to help managers track their employees and employees' salaries I have created an application that takes first names, last names and salary value inputs and provides a nice table with all the info. This application also provides an average of all the salaries and a random employee name is chosen in the console.


## Installation

To run this application, either visit https://chris21789.github.io/Employee-Payroll-Tracker/ or download the zip zile from https://github.com/Chris21789/Employee-Payroll-Tracker, extract the files into a folder, open the folder with Visual Studio code, right click the index.html file and select Open with Live Server. 
    
## Usage/Examples

To use this application click the Add Employees button and follow the input prompts. After the salary prompt, a prompt to add another employee will appear. If you'd like to add additional employees select ok and if there are no more employees to be added hit cancel. At this point a table will be created on the page. If you open the console by right clicking an empty section of the page, choosing inspect and clicking Console you'll see a few messages regarding the average salary and an employees name choosen at random.
